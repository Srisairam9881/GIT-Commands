            <h2>What is Git Restore?</h2>
            <p>Git restore is a command in Git that allows you to restore files or directories in your working directory to their state at a specific commit or to discard changes made since the last commit. It is useful for undoing changes and reverting to a known state.</p>

            <h2>Git Restore Commands</h2>
            <p>To restore a specific file or directory to its state at a specific commit, you can use:</p>
            <code>git restore --source=&lt;commit&gt; --staged --worktree &lt;file&gt;</code>
            <p>This command restores the specified file or directory to its state at the given commit. The <code>--staged</code> option restores the file in the staging area, and the <code>--worktree</code> option restores it in the working directory.</p>
            <p>To discard changes made to a specific file in the working directory and restore it to the state of the last commit, you can use:</p>
            <code>git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree &lt;file&gt;</code>
            <p>This command discards changes made to the specified file and restores it to the state of the last commit.</p>
            <p>If you want to discard all changes made to the entire working directory and restore it to the state of the last commit, you can use:</p>
            <code>git restore .</code>
            <p>This command discards all changes made to the working directory and restores it to the state of the last commit.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="example">
            <h2>Example Usage</h2>
            <p>Let's consider a scenario where you made some changes to a file but later realized that those changes were incorrect. To discard those changes and restore the file to its state at the last commit, you can use:</p>
            <code>git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree &lt;file&gt;</code>
            <p>This command will revert the file to its state at the last commit, effectively undoing the changes you made.</p>
